## Installation Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn joblib category-encoders
```

## Usage

### Unified CLI Interface (Recommended)
Use the new organized entry point for all calculators:

```bash
python run_calculator.py
```

This provides an organized menu system with calculators grouped by medical domain.

### Individual Calculator Modules
Each calculator can also be run independently:

```bash
# New organized structure
python aerospace_medicine/heat_stress/strain_index.py
python aerospace_medicine/decompression/dcs_risk.py
python aerospace_medicine/cold_stress/wind_chill.py

# Legacy scripts (still available)
python PhysiolStrainIndex.py
python DCSCalcV5.py
python WCT.py
```

### Web Interface
For the interactive web app:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
